flask_evolution - Our Flask learning app

In this commit, we make it possible to enter data through the web page views themselves.


To do that, we first need to install the WTForms package.

Then we lay out some forms on our templates and link them to the backend through a forms.py file. We include links to those forms on the main landing page.
